# computer vision - cat image
This Jupyter notebook plays with a cat image using computer vision (Open CV2), and did a few simple image processing / manipulation.

Load the image images/cat2.png: 

![funny cat](images/cat2.png)

then perform the following:
1.	Image scaling: Reduce the image to half of its original size.
  
2.	Rotation: Rotate the image by 30 degrees clockwise.

3.	Edge detection:	
- Apply the Sobel filter in both the X and Y directions and combine the results.
- Additionally, apply the Canny filter to highlight the edges.

5.	Comparison of results:
Create a visualization that shows the original image and the results of the Sobel and Canny filters side by side.
